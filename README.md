RiiConnect24 IOS Patcher WiiDatabase Edition
============================================

An improved version of the [RiiConnect24 IOS Patcher](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/IOS-Patcher) by KcrPL and Larsenv. It *works*, but the code is a mess imho. May improve it someday.

## Main changes:
* Rewrote from scratch
* Checks downloaded IOS and patched files against their checksums
* Works from Windows XP to 10
* Faster without unnecessary questions

## Todo
* [ ] Better download and patching code without [lotsa spaghetti](https://abload.de/img/hqdefaultj8s9a.jpg)
* [ ] Check MD5 of patched files before downloading them
* [ ] Speaking of MD5, switch to a more secure algorithm
